            <code>Matplotlib</code> has a high level of functionality as a free, open-source graphing and plotting platform.  The plots it produces can easily
            be embedded in html documents, where they may serve as visuals for scientists displaying their work to interested parties.  One of the more stable
            Python libraries, its use has continued to increase due to its versatility and robust module integration.

            I hope you have gained some new knowledge from this tutorial and feel comfortable with embedding <code>matplotlib</code> graphics into an 
            html document!  It is a great way to  show your research to a prospective student or to show funding donors the results or progress of your
            work.  Happy Coding :)
